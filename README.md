# Woolworths Village Wallet Android SDK

This project contains an Android library that can facilitate
applications accessing the Village API.

| :memo: | The SDK is currently in development. Therefore parts may change. |
|--------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|

## Usage

The SDK is has the following core design philosophies.

1. Technology agnostic. Different applications may have different technology
choices and an SDK shouldn't force an application to depend on a different
technology stack as this bloats the build and increases complexity.

2. Swappable. Don't like a particular implementation of a part in the
SDK, then swap it out for another object that implements the correct
interface.

The SDK comprises of:
 - An adaption layer between the Application and the API
 - An API layer which knows how to communicate with the Village API
 - An authentication layer.

Applications have the flexibility to plug in different implementations of
the interfaces to allow particular technology choices (eg: choice of
HTTP client library). This makes it very easy to use the SDK in an
existing project, without necessarily introducing extra dependencies.

The entry point for applications is the `createCustomerSDK` or
`createCustomerSDK` functions depending on the goals of the application.

### Authentication layer

In order to access protected APIs, the SDK will need to know how to
authenticate with the API or a gateway that protects the API. The
`ApiAuthenticator` interface abstracts how the SDK authenticates from
the rest of the API interface. Applications that have a preexisting
authentication workflow can either update the relevant classes to implement the
`ApiAuthenticator` interface, or provide an [Adapter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern#Java)
to make the existing authentication details available to the SDK.

### API layer

The API layer is decoupled from the rest of the SDK via the
`VillageCustomerApiRepository` and `VillageMerchantApiRepository`
interfaces. Consumers need to configure their `Village` instance with
an implementation of the correct repository that conforms to needs and
technology choices of the application.

#### Open API Implementation

For convenience, the [Woolworths Village SDK Open API Repository](https://github.com/woolworthslimited/paysdk2-openapi)
project provides an implementation of the API Repository interfaces
that wraps an API Client created with the Open API generator.

#### Reference Application

A [Reference Application](https://github.com/woolworthslimited/paysdk2-reference-android) is available
to demonstrate the use of the SDK. The library can be imported directly into a project
or Gradle Composite Builds can be used.

## Versioning

The SDK follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) principles.
As such if the API specification changes in a way that introduces breaking
changes (eg: path change or data changes) the major version of the SDK
will be increased.

The SDK currently supports version 1.0.5 of the API spec.

## Getting started

Read the [ðŸ“˜ SDK reference docs](/sdk/docs/sdk/index.html) for more information on the different types
in the SDK.

### Example usage

The examples use the Open API implementation, however any class conforming to the correct interface
can be used

```kotlin
fun createCustomerVillage(): VillageCustomerApiRepository {
    // read the docs on all the options available
    val options = VillageCustomerOptions(
        apiKey = "<your key here>",
        baseUrl = "http://my.app.host.com/context/root"
    )

    return createCustomerSDK(
        options, 

        // see the docs on how we can use different token types.
        ApiTokenType.StringToken("abc123"),

        OpenApiCustomerApiRepositoryFactory
    )
}
```

The different methods on the SDK can be now used.

### Documentation

The SDK reference docs are generated using [Dokka](https://github.com/Kotlin/dokka)

```shell
$ ./gradlew dokkaHtml
```

## Publishing

Newer versions of the SDK are tagged in GitHub and are published to Package Cloud
